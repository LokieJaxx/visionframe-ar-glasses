# VisionFrame: AR Smart Glasses with EnChroma + AI

**Created by:** Stephen Kollman  
**Status:** Concept/Planning Phase  

VisionFrame is a custom-designed, AI-powered pair of smart glasses. My goal is to create everyday-wearable glasses with a waveguide AR display, stereo cameras, voice assistant tools (like ChatGPT), and **EnChroma-style colorblind correction**.

This repository will document my journey from concept to prototype as a student developer working on accessible, wearable tech.

## Key Features (Planned)
- Binocular AR display (HUD across both lenses)
- EnChroma-based colorblind correction (real-time digital overlay)
- ChatGPT/voice scripting support
- Stereo cameras + 3D awareness
- Prescription photochromic lenses
- Bone conduction audio
- Gesture & eye tracking (planned)

## Why It Matters
This project brings accessibility and productivity together in a wearable form â€” built for creators, developers, and everyday users.

## Next Steps
- Document specs
- Gather support
- Apply for GitHub Sponsors
- Begin prototyping
