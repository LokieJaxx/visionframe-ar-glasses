# VisionFrame: Professional AI-Powered AR Smart Glasses

**Author:** Stephen Kollman  
**Role:** IT Specialist | Developer | Wearable Technology Innovator  
**Status:** Concept Planning & Research Phase  

VisionFrame is a next-generation wearable project focused on creating a fully integrated pair of **augmented reality smart glasses** built for **daily professional use**. Designed to replace standard eyewear, these glasses combine cutting-edge AR display, AI assistant integration, stereo cameras, and accessibility enhancements — all within a discreet, matte-black frame suitable for full-time wear.

This repository documents the planning, research, and early development phases of the system.

## Core Objectives

- **Create a true all-day wearable smart glasses system** optimized for IT professionals and developers
- **Leverage AI and AR to streamline daily workflows**, task management, and system access
- **Prioritize accessibility**, including color vision correction and hands-free control
- Maintain a **minimal, professional appearance** indistinguishable from standard eyewear

## Planned Features

| Category            | Feature Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Display**         | Binocular waveguide HUD across both lenses                                          |
| **Audio**           | Bone conduction or directional private audio system                                 |
| **Cameras**         | Dual discreet stereo cameras with 3D spatial input & gesture tracking               |
| **AI Integration**  | ChatGPT-powered voice assistant with scripting and SSH command overlays             |
| **Lenses**          | Prescription-ready, photochromic lenses (clear indoors, tinted in sunlight)         |
| **Accessibility**   | Real-time colorblind correction via EnChroma-style digital overlays                 |
| **Battery + Power** | All-day operation on a single charge; wireless charging support                     |
| **Form Factor**     | Matte black frame; minimal weight; indistinguishable from regular glasses            |

## Why This Technology Is Necessary

Despite rapid advances in mixed reality and voice AI, there is **no existing product** that:
- Combines all of these capabilities into a truly **wearable, discreet form factor**
- Offers **real-time accessibility enhancements** (like EnChroma and hands-free assistant scripting)
- Prioritizes **professional, full-time daily use** rather than entertainment or enterprise-only AR

VisionFrame fills this critical gap with a **professional-first**, AI-enhanced tool designed for developers, technologists, and accessibility-focused users.
